# reconstruction-attacks
Code for hands-on experience with reconstruction attacks in a simple setting. To start using it, upload linear_query_server.py as a web app on a suitable server, for example using pythonanywhere.com. Once the server is up the reconstruction attack code can use it to answer linear queries. A baseline implementation is included as a template.
